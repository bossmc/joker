# Joker is a simple Wildcard implementation that works much like Regexps.
#

require 'joker_native'

#
# Implements wildcards for Ruby. Modeled after the Regexp class.
#
# This implementation supports the following special characters:
#
# - ?      matches a single character
# - *      matches any number of characters, including 0
# - \\*    matches a literal '*'
# - \\?    matches a literal '?'
# - \\\\   matches a literal '\\'
# - [xyz]  matches either 'x', 'y' or 'z'. NOTE that you have
#          to escape ']' in these groups: \\]
#
# NOTE that '\\a' will match the literal string '\\a', not 'a' as
# one might expect.
#
#   wild = Wildcard['Fairy?ake*']
#   wild =~ 'Fairycake'                     #=> true
#   wild =~ 'Fairyfakes are mean'           #=> true
#   wild =~ 'Fairysteakes are delicious'    #=> false
#
# Also there is a case sensitivity flag. By default it is set to true,
# but it can be turned off at construction time:
#
#   wild = Wildcard['Fairy?ake*', true]
#   wild =~ 'Fairycake'
#   wild =~ 'fairyCAKE'
#   wild =~ 'FaIrYfAkEs, the Movie'
#
# Furthermore, any given Wildcard expression must match the whole string:
#
#   wild = Wildcard['Fairy?ake']
#   wild =~ 'some Fairycake'                #=> false
#   wild =~ 'Fairycake is good for you'     #=> false
#
class Wildcard

    #
    # Boolean. Determines case sensitivity of the Wildcard.
    #
    # If this is true, the Wildcard will ignore case.
    #
    attr_reader :casefold

    #

    #
