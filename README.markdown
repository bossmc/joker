<http://karottenreibe.github.com/joker>

Joker is a simple Wildcard (a.k.a Glob Pattern) implementition
for Ruby.

## Features ##

*   Behaves much like Regexp
*   ` * ` and ` ? ` as wildcard characters
*   ` \ ` for escaping:
    ` \? ` matches ` ? `,
    ` \* ` matches ` * `,
    ` \[ ` matches ` [ `,
    ` \] ` matches ` ] `,
*   But for all other characters:
    ` \a ` matches ` \a `, but not ` a `
*   Wildcards must always match whole string
    (thus ` uiae ` will only match the string ` uiae `)
*   Wildcards can be case insensitive

## Installation ##

    gem install joker

## Usage ##

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'joker'


    wild = Wildcard['Fairy?ake*']

    wild =~ 'Fairycake'                     #=> true
    wild =~ 'Fairyfakes'                    #=> true
    wild =~ 'Fairylake is a cool place'     #=> true

    wild =~ 'Dairycake'                     #=> false
    wild =~ 'Fairysteakes'                  #=> false
    wild =~ 'fairycake'                     #=> false

    wildi = Wildcard['Fairy?ake*\?', true]

    wildi =~ 'FairyCake?'                   #=> true
    wildi =~ 'fairyfakes?'                  #=> true
    wildi =~ 'FairyLake IS A COOL Place?'   #=> true

    Wildcard.quote('*?\\')                  #=> '\\*\\?\\\\'
